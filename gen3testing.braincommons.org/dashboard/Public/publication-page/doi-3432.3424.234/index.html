                    There is mounting evidence of systemic inflammation in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
                    Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), yet inconsistency and a lack of replicability in findings of
                    putative biological markers have delayed progress in this space. Variability in performance between
                    platforms may contribute to the lack of consensus in the biomarker literature, as has been seen for
                    a number of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. Thus, there is a need for high-performance,
                    scalable, and validated platforms for the discovery and development of biomarkers of inflammation
                    for use in drug development and as clinical diagnostics. To identify the best platform for use in
                    future biomarker discovery efforts, we conducted a comprehensive cross-platform and cross-assay
                    evaluation across five leading platform technologies. This initial assessment focused on four
                    cytokines that have been implicated PTSD &ndash; interleukin (IL)-1&beta;, IL-6, tumor necrosis
                    factor (TNF)-&alpha;, and interferon (IFN)-&gamma;
                    <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">. To assess platform performance and understand likely
                        measurements in individuals with brain disorders, serum and plasma samples were obtained from
                        individuals with PTSD (n=13) or Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (PD, n=14) as well as healthy controls
                        (n=5). We compared platform performance across a number of common analytic parameters, including
                        assay precision, sensitivity, frequency of endogenous analyte detection, correlation between
                        platforms, and parallelism in measurement of cytokines using a serial dilution series. The
                        single molecule array (Simoa&trade;) ultra-sensitive platform (Quanterix), MESO V-Plex
                        (Mesoscale Discovery), and Luminex xMAP&reg; (Myriad) were conducted by their respective
                        vendors, while Luminex&reg; and Quantikine&reg; high-sensitivity ELISA assays were evaluated by
                        R&amp;D System&rsquo;s Biomarker Testing Services. The assay with the highest sensitivity in
                        detecting endogenous analytes across all analytes and clinical populations (i.e. the highest
                        frequency of endogenous analytes detection (FEAD)), was the Simoa&trade; platform. In contrast,
                        more variable performance was observed for MESO V-plex, R&amp;D Luminex&reg; and
                        Quantikine&reg;, while Myriad&rsquo;s Luminex xMAP&reg; exhibited low FEAD across all analytes
                        and samples.
                        Simoa&trade; also demonstrated high precision in detecting endogenous cytokines, as reflected in
                        &lt;20 percent coefficient of variance (%CV) across replicate runs for samples from the healthy
                        controls, PTSD patients, and PD patients. In contrast, MESO V-Plex, R&amp;D Luminex&reg; and
                        Quantikine&reg; had variable performance in terms of precision across cytokines. Note that
                        Myriad Luminex xMAP&reg; could not be included in precision estimates because the vendor did not
                        run samples in duplicate. For cross-platform performance comparisons, the highest cross-platform
                        correlations were observed for IL-6 such that all platforms &ndash; except for Myriad&rsquo;s
                        Luminex xMAP&reg; &ndash; had strong correlations with one another in measurements of IL-6 (r
                        range = 0.59 &ndash; 0.86). For the other cytokines, there was low to no correlation across
                        platforms, such that reported measurements of IL-1&beta;, TNF-&alpha;, and IFN-&gamma; varied
                        across assays. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence that the choice of
                        immunoassay could greatly impact reported cytokine findings. The current study provides crucial
                        information on the variability in performance between platforms and across immunoassays that may
                        help inform the selection of assay in future research studies.
                        Further, the results emphasize the need for performing comparative evaluations of immunoassays
                        as new technologies emerge over time, particularly given the lack of reference standards for the
                        quantitative assessments of cytokines.</span>
