                This study contains genotype and associated transcriptome profile 
                from hepatocytes obtained from African American livers. Transcriptomes 
                were measured under the following seven treatments: Phenobarbital, 
                Dexamethasone, Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Rifampicin, DSMO, and 
                Omeprazole. Indications on which drug is used can be found on the 
                last digit of the submitter_id:
                XX-YY-Z, where Z displays a number from 1 to 7 indicating which 
                drug is used. DSMO is 1, Omeprazole is 2, Phenobarbital is 3, 
                Dexamethasone is 4, Carbamazepine is 5, Phenytoin is 6, and 
                Rifampicin is 7.
                Genotype data includes submitted aligned reads and aligned read 
                index files in the form of BAM files. Phenotype data consists of 
                basic demographics when available.  All data is also available 
                at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147628">GSE147628</a>,

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">
                Users can download clinical metadata directly from the Data Explorer (section 
                a below) or download files to their local environment by following 2 different 
                processes. The first process allows for single-file downloads directly through 
                the portal, and is explained in Section b below. The second process allows for 
                multi-file downloads by leveraging the Gen3-client and a python SDK, as 
                detailed in Section c.

                Users can download clinical data and file metadata from the Explorer Page. 
                On the Subject Tab, users can download dynamically updated virtual cohorts at the subject level in table format, for example demographics, clinical data, and the submitter_ids. 
                On the File Tab, users can download metadata associated with the data files, such as size, guids, data type, and submitter_ids.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users need to click “Download Table” to save it to the local machine.

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">
                Gen3-powered Data Commons employ a data model which describes, organizes, 
                and establishes relationships for data across different datasets. The data 
                model organizes and connects different categories, <i>"nodes"</i>, with experimental 
                metadata variables, <i>“properties”</i>. The data dictionary describes all nodes and 
                enlisting properties in each node. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On ACCOuNT, the dictionary page contains an interactive representation of the 
                Gen3 data model in two forms, “graph model” and “table view”, which is described below. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Note:</em> the Gen3 Data Dictionary encompasses <i>all study metadata</i> displayed 
                in the Gen3 ACCOuNT portal. Not all studies will contain data associated with 
                the different nodes and properties available.
