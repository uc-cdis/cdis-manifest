                    There is mounting evidence of systemic inflammation in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
                    Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), yet inconsistency and a lack of replicability in findings of
                    putative biological markers have delayed progress in this space. Variability in performance between
                    platforms may contribute to the lack of consensus in the biomarker literature, as has been seen for
                    a number of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. Thus, there is a need for high-performance,
                    scalable, and validated platforms for the discovery and development of biomarkers of inflammation
                    for use in drug development and as clinical diagnostics. To identify the best platform for use in
                    future biomarker discovery efforts, we conducted a comprehensive cross-platform and cross-assay
                    evaluation across five leading platform technologies. This initial assessment focused on four
                    cytokines that have been implicated PTSD &ndash; interleukin (IL)-1&beta;, IL-6, tumor necrosis
                    factor (TNF)-&alpha;, and interferon (IFN)-&gamma;<span id="dots">&nbsp;...</span><span id="more">.
                        To assess platform performance and understand likely
                        measurements in individuals with brain disorders, serum and plasma samples were obtained from
                        individuals with PTSD (n = 13) or Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease (n = 14) as well as healthy controls
                        (n = 5). We compared platform performance across a number of common analytic parameters,
                        including assay precision, sensitivity, frequency of endogenous analyte detection (FEAD),
                        correlation between platforms, and parallelism in measurement of cytokines using a serial
                        dilution series. The single molecule array (Simoa&trade;) ultra-sensitive platform (Quanterix),
                        MESO V-Plex (Mesoscale Discovery), and Luminex xMAP&reg; (Myriad) were conducted by their
                        respective vendors, while Luminex&reg; and Quantikine&reg; high-sensitivity ELISA assays were
                        evaluated by R&amp;D System&rsquo;s Biomarker Testing Services. The assay with the highest
                        sensitivity in detecting endogenous analytes across all analytes and clinical populations (i.e.
                        the highest FEAD), was the Simoa&trade; platform. In contrast, more variable performance was
                        observed for MESO V-plex, R&amp;D Luminex&reg; and Quantikine&reg;, while Myriad&rsquo;s Luminex
                        xMAP&reg; exhibited low FEAD across all analytes and samples. Simoa&trade; also demonstrated
                        high precision in detecting endogenous cytokines, as reflected in &lt; 20 percent coefficient of
                        variance (%CV) across replicate runs for samples from the healthy controls, PTSD patients, and
                        PD
                        patients. In contrast, MESO V-Plex, R&amp;D Luminex&reg; and Quantikine&reg; had variable
                        performance in terms of precision across cytokines. Myriad Luminex xMAP&reg; could not be
                        included in precision estimates because the vendor did not run samples in duplicate. For
                        cross-platform performance comparisons, the highest cross-platform correlations were observed
                        for IL-6 such that all platforms &ndash; except for Myriad&rsquo;s Luminex xMAP&reg; &ndash; had
                        strong correlations with one another in measurements of IL-6 (r range = 0.59 &ndash; 0.86). For
                        the other cytokines, there was low to no correlation across platforms, such that reported
                        measurements of IL-1&beta;, TNF-&alpha;, and IFN-&gamma; varied across assays. Taken together,
                        these findings provide novel evidence that the choice of immunoassay could greatly impact
                        reported cytokine findings. The current study provides crucial information on the variability in
                        performance between platforms and across immunoassays that may help inform the selection of
                        assay in future research studies. Further, the results emphasize the need for performing
                        comparative evaluations of immunoassays as new technologies emerge over time, particularly given
                        the lack of reference standards for the quantitative assessments of cytokines.</span>
