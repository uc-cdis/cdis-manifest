,
Demographics and outcomes,
Age,"Patient age, except those >=89 years old are aggregated into a group per Safe Harbor deidentification guidelines; this group is  labeled 91"
BMI,Patient body mass index [Kg/m2]
Outcome,"Disposition of where they were discharged to, as recorded in electronic health record"
Superinfection,"Superinfection was defined as bacterial infection co-occurring with a viral pathogen diagnosed by BAL sampling. For the purposes of this report, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) refers to incident bacterial pneumonia occurring after at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation in patients who were enrolled as a non-pneumonia control or who were enrolled with viral pneumonia (due to SARS-CoV-2 or another virus) but who did not have evidence of an underlying viral infection at the time of the current BAL sample (i.e., had cleared their viral infection)."
