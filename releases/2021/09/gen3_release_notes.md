# Core Gen3 Release 202109 (Talleyâ€™s Corner)

## uc-cdis/fence

#### Improvements
  - Update "/delete" endpoint documentation (#953)
  - Fix the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint to always return the 
    environment's base URL in the `issuer` field, instead of returning the 
    upstream Fence IDP's base URL (#952)
  - Add `samesite="Lax"` to cookies of `access_token` and `fence` (#951)
  - Only try to update Google IAM with billing permissions for an SA if the SA 
    creds are NOT cached, e.g. only do it once per cache of the creds to reduce 
    unnecessary network calls to Google (#938)
  - When deciding whether to sign a URL for download, do not rely on "acl" if 
    the record has an "authz" (#949)
  - Once we retire the k8s sidecar containers from fence's k8s YAML (here: 
    https://github.com/uc-cdis/cloud-automation/pull/1643), old fence images 
    will face a lot of log noise as the HTTP metrics endpoints will no longer 
    exist. (#941)
