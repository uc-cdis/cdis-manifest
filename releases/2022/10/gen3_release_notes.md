  - deployments changes for WebAPI: now it'll have an nginx container which 
    will be exposed, instead of WebAPI (and Tomcat) directly; this is needed 
    because WebAPI does not have an option to overwrite schema to https, when 
    it's running behind reverse proxy (ALB or any other), because of this the 
    [`proxy_redirect`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_redirect)
    probably the best solution to rewrite `Location` header, effectively 
    changing the schema. (#2021)
