  - The link to hatcheryOverview.md was broken as the path to the file in the

## uc-cdis/sheepdog

#### New Features
  - Switch checks guarding program/project CRUD to centralized auth (instead of 
    checking for "admin" in JWT, check for Sheepdog admin policy in Arborist) 
    (#319)

#### Deployment Changes
  - The environment's user.yaml needs to be updated to add the new Sheepdog 
    admin policy/resources/roles; for each user that has admin: true, grant 
    them the new policy. See https://github.com/uc-cdis/commons-users/pull/810 
    for an example. (#319)

  - Having admin: true in user.yaml no longer allows a user to do 
    program/project CRUD in Sheepdog. Users now need to have the Sheepdog admin 
    policy in Arborist. (#319)
