# Core Gen3 Release 2024.10 (Cassiterite)

## Release Highlights and Announcements

#### Integration of Grafana Faro for frontend RUM
  - Data portal now has [integrated support](#new-features-1) for gathering user metrics via Grafana Faro.

#### Single-table option for IndexD
  - IndexD has a new configuration option that consolidates multiple relational tables into a [single record table](#new-features-4). The single-table 
option can provide a significant performance advantage.  Switching an existing commons to this configuration requires 
migration of the database to the new schema.

#### Support in Fence for generating presigned URLs for requester-pays S3 buckets
  - We've added the capability for Fence to [generate presigned URLs for data in requester-pays-enabled AWS S3 buckets](#new-features-3).
