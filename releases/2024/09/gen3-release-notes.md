# Core Gen3 Release 2024.09 (Bytownite)

## Release Highlights and Announcements

#### Required database migration to update Fence
If the ENABLE_DB_MIGRATION setting is enabled in your Fence configuration, the migration will run automatically. Otherwise, for cloud-automation deployments, run `gen3 job run fence-db-migrate`, or for any kubernetes deployment, run `kubectl exec <fence pod name> -- fence-create migrate`. 

#### Authorization change: case-insensitive comparison of usernames in Arborist
Arborist has been updated to make case-insensitive comparisons of usernames. This complies with the assumptions of many authorization systems and gen3 installations.

#### Community Contribution - force cluster-local URLs in Hatchery
You can now set a configuration option to [force hatchery to use cluster-local URLs](#improvements-4) (like http://fence-service/) even when the `GEN3_ENDPOINT` environmental variable is set.

Thanks to the community for contributing this to the Gen3 product codebase!

#### Multiple enhancements to Fence
We've added support for deleting files from non-AWS S3 compatible endpoints; given admins more flexibility to choose their preferred data storage while keeping AWS S3 as the default; and added support for an optional guid in the request body for the `/upload` and `/multipart/init` endpoints so that blank records can be created if the guid does not exist. We've also cleaned up the documentation to make it easier to find information.
