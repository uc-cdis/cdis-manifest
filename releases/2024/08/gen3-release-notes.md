# Core Gen3 Release 2024.08 (Brazilianite)

## Release Highlights and Announcements

#### Breaking change in Fence
This release of Gen3 includes a breaking change to Fence due to a major upgrade to the underlying OIDC library. 
When updating to Gen3 2024.08 (Fence 10.0.0 or newer), Gen3 administrators must run a Fence database migration when they update the version of Fence. 

Fence database migrations can be run using the `fence-create` client included with Fence. See `fence-create --help` for the commands.  If you need assistance, please ask on the Gen3 Community Slack channel.  The release is here: https://github.com/uc-cdis/fence/releases/tag/10.0.0 .

Since Fence uses the database library `alembic` for safe upgrades and downgrades of db schemas, there is a way to downgrade Fence if necessary after the upgrade. Nonetheless, we recommend a snapshot or backup before any major migration, like this one. 

#### Community Contributions

Sower has been updated with [support for configurable job TTL](#new-features-2).

## uc-cdis/data-portal

#### New Features
  - Update Team Projects Modal for use case where user does not have teams 
    available ([#1557](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1557))
  - Add storybook page for new Modal ([#1557](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1557)) 
  - Updates the Discovery Action Bar so that filtered metadata is sent to the 
    ```${manifestServiceApiPath}/metadata``` after the user clicks the export 
    to workspace button, pending that they have enabled 
    ```discoveryConfig.features.exportToWorkspace.enableExportFullMetadata```. 
    The filtering removes any field that has been defined in 
    ```discoveryConfig.features.exportToWorkspace.excludedMetadataFields```, if 
    that config field exists. Note that field names in 
    ```discoveryConfig.features.exportToWorkspace.excludedMetadataFields``` can 
    represent nested fields, for example ```study_metadata.username```. ([#1534](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1534)) 
  - add html mark for accessibility ([#1546](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1546)) 
  - add NVM file to allow for using nvm command to run correct version of node 
    and npm ([#1542](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1542))

#### Bug Fixes
  - Consider `*` as one of the included values when checking for `create` and 
    `update` permissions ([#1566](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1566)) 
  - Study reg: fixed a bug causing pre-defined data repository metadata got 
    overwritten by user ([#1560](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1560)) 
  - Fix explorer table header sorting issue ([#1554](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1554)) 
  - remove already selected covariates from list to eliminate ability to add 
    multiple times ([#1549](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1549))

#### Improvements
  - Add support for hyperlinks in the study viewer detailed description. 
    ([#1565](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1565))
  - Misc: added descriptions about `fileCountField` into docs ([#1563](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1563)) 
  - Discovery: re-org some data avalibility icons and states. `Pending` has 
    been renamed to `Waiting` and has became the default state for metadata 
    that doesn't have an `authz` value. `Not Avaliable` now is a state that 
    need to be explicitly set from a metadata field. ([#1558](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1558)) 
  - The DiscoveryActionBar component has been modularized into separate 
    components, utils, constants and interfaces. ([#1534](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1534))

    it with new ClinicalTrials.gov API v2.0 ([#1540](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1540)) 

#### Deployment Changes
  - Discovery: The `Pending` state has been renamed to `Waiting` and has became 
    the default state for metadata that doesn't have an `authz` value. If an 
    env is using this state, it needs to update its portal config accordingly 
    ([#1558](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1558))
  - Need to update to CEDAR wrapper 0.5.0 
    https://github.com/uc-cdis/cedar-wrapper-service/releases/tag/0.5.0 for 
    this feature ([#1540](https://github.com/uc-cdis/data-portal/pull/1540))

#### Bugfix
